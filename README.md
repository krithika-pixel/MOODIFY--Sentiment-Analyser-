MOODIFY- The Sentiment Analyser

This project uses real-world textual data,  customer reviews, comments, or survey responses, to analyze how the audience feels about a given topic. 
It determines whether the overall sentiment expressed in the text is positive, negative, or neutral.
In addition to polarity, the system also evaluates subjectivity, identifying whether the text is based on personal opinions and emotions (subjective) or on facts and objective statements (objective). 
This combination of polarity and subjectivity analysis provides a deeper understanding of how people think and feel in real-world contexts.
